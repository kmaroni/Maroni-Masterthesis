# Maroni Masterthesis
This repo contains code for the implementations and their plots used in my master thesis titled Neural Networks: Bridging Convergence Theory, Convex Optimization, and Practical Implementation.  

# Polynomial approximation:
poly_approx_KAN_test1.py, poly_approx_KAN_test2_3.py and poly_approx_KAN_test4.py was used for section 6.2

poly_coeff.py was used for Appendix B

# Experiments:
example_network.py was used for section 7.1

activation_comparison.py was used for section 7.2

loss_comparison.py was used for section 7.3
